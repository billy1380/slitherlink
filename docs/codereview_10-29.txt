Sherri Code Reivew:

    -mac C++ make files
    -clang (on mac at least) isntead of gcc
    -push corrected README
    -don't read from STDIN, command line arguments
    -profiler

    -comments at top of h files
    -comments at top of functions

    -(in code or seperate file) have algorithms written out in English (high level solver & lower level
    functions too)

    -isSolved, numberSatisfied (keep track of numbers Satisfied/isSolved throughout solving)
    -isSolved first if statement logic :P

    -yay use const.

    -How to seperate solver into smaller classes?
        -class diagrams?
        -"I wouldn't get overly perfectionist"
