In order to have consistently styled code, here is a style guide with conventions we will use

- 4 space indentation - no tabs except in Makefile
- Opening brace on same line as statement
    eg if (x == y) {

Naming conventions
- Class names: upper camel case
- Method names: lower camel case
- Just read the         Google style guide
