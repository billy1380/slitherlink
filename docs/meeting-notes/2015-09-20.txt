Todo:
    - Set up git repository
    - Text representation of grid
    - Implemented representation of grid
    - Validation of completed grids

Text representation of grid
    - Store in a way analogous to data in program
    - 3 separate parts:
        * numbers
        * horizontal lines
        * vertical lines

Implemented representation of grid
    - m rows, n columns
    - Store in three parts
        * numbers (m x n)
        * horizontal lines (m+1 x n)
        * vertical lines (m x n+1)
    - Contour class (for each line segment)
        * id (?) (int)
        * points (vector<int>)
        * end points (int, int)
        * closed (bool)
        * length (int)
    - Number class
        * number of adjacent lines
        * done (bool)
        * index in array (int)
        * top(), bottom(), left(), right()
