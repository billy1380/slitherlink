0. Iteratively perform all rule searches until no changes occur
1. Compile a list of known endpoints 
2. For each endpoint of a contour, make guess of either lines or x's, equal to guess radius (start with manhattan distance 1)
2a. If a guess cannot be correct, add a line if the guess was an x; add an x if the guess was a line, then go back to step 0 with updated puzzle
2b. If all guesses are possible, expand guess radius by 1 (still manhattan distance)
